# Coniunctio

*Coniunctio* is my personal manifesto, the product of a year-long process of Jungian individuation, shadow work, and reflective self-analysis. It captures the essence of my core identity, values, philosophy, and vision.

The name *Coniunctio* evokes the union of opposites within the psyche, as explored in Jungâ€™s *Mysterium Coniunctionis*, and acknowledges the layered experiences, archetypal influences, and conscious efforts that have shaped who I am today.
